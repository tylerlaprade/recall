# recall

Ever lost a conversation session with Claude Code, Codex, pi or Grok and wish you could resume it? This skill lets your agents search across all your past conversations with full-text search. Builds a SQLite FTS5 index over `~/.claude/projects/`, `~/.codex/sessions/`, `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`, and `~/.grok/sessions/` with BM25 ranking, Porter stemming, CJK support, and incremental updates.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add arjunkmrm/recall
```

Then use `/recall` in Claude Code (or Codex, pi, or Grok) or ask "find a past session where we talked about foo" (you might need to restart your agent).

## How it works
### Index

```
  ~/.claude/projects/**/*.jsonl ──┐
                                  │
  ~/.codex/sessions/**/*.jsonl ───┼─▶ Index ──▶ ~/.recall.db (SQLite FTS5)
                                  │   [incremental - mtime-based]
  ~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl │
  ~/.grok/sessions/**/chat_history.jsonl ┘
```
### Query
```
  Query ──▶ Detect CJK? ──▶ FTS5 Match ──▶ BM25 rank ──▶ Recency boost ──▶ Results
                │                           [half-life: 30 days]
                │
          ┌─────┴──────┐

```

- Indexes user/assistant messages into a SQLite FTS5 database at `~/.recall.db`
- First run indexes all sessions (a few seconds); subsequent runs only process new/modified files
- Dual-table FTS: Porter stemming for English, trigram tokenizer for CJK (Japanese, Chinese, Korean)
- CJK messages are selectively indexed into the trigram table; query routing is automatic
- Skips tool_use, tool_result, thinking, and image blocks
- Results ranked by BM25 with a slight recency bias (recent sessions get up to a 20% boost, decaying with a 30-day half-life)
- Results tagged `[claude]`, `[codex]`, `[pi]`, or `[grok]` with highlighted excerpts
- No dependencies — Python 3.9+ stdlib only (sqlite3, json, argparse)

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover tests -v
```

Stdlib `unittest` only — no test deps. Synthetic JSONL fixtures generated
in `tmpdir` from the suite itself (no fixture files committed). An
integration test runs against any real pi sessions in `~/.pi/agent/sessions/`
on the host and is skipped if none are present.
